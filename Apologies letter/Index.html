                <p>Dear Mavie ko</p>
                <p>I’m writing this with a heavy heart because I know I hurt you and I deeply regret it. Last night, I said a word that hurt your feelings. At that moment, 
                I didn’t fully understand what you wanted or how you were feeling and because of that misunderstanding and I made a careless mistake. That mistake caused you pain and made you cry and knowing that breaks my heart.</p>
                <p>I want to be clear there is no excuse for what I said. Even if I was confused or didn’t understand the situation, I should have been more patient, more careful, and more sensitive to your feelings. My words came out wrong and I take full responsibility for them.</p>
                <p>Seeing how much I hurt you made me realize how important your feelings are and how my actions affect you. I never intended to cause you pain but I understand now that intention doesn’t erase the hurt. I am truly sorry for the tears I caused and for failing to be the person you needed in that moment.</p>
                <p>I am learning from this and I promise to do better to listen more, to think before I speak, and to try harder to understand you instead of reacting without care. You mean so much to me and the last thing I ever want is to be the reason for your sadness.</p>
                <p>If you need time, I understand. If you’re not ready to forgive me yet I will respect that. I just want you to know how deeply sorry I am and how much I value you and our relationship.</p>
                <p>Thank you for reading this Mavie ko. Please know that you are always in my thoughts and I truly hope I can make things right.</p>
                <p>I just want you to know that I always Love you Mavie ko 💙</p>
